### What I learned

 - I have learned and understand more about the positioning in CSS particularly with absolute position. It is not easy to have a responsive width and centering a div with position:absolute
 - Understanding the use of flex and grid
 - margins of box model cannot have a color background. it color background only affects the padding of the box model

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
